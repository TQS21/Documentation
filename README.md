# Howls Moving Library

## Abstract

As a project for the TQS subject, we will explain the development of a viable software product, which will have the purpose of enforcing and enhancing the use of a software quality assurance strategy which should be applied in any software engineering project. Our application is a delivery service designed to deliver books to your home and return it, like in a library. In the application, we will have an interface for the delivery employees which will associate them to a requesting client and show where the destination is; an interface for the user which will show the different books available at the moment; and an interface for admins to manage rider's choices and to view details of every order.
